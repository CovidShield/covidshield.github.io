          COVID Shield is a free-to-use exposure notification solution built
          with privacy as its top priority. It is built by a group of volunteers
          in Canada in order to help people safely return to work.

        <p>
          COVID Shield is a private, secure, and easy-to-use tool to help
          governments in Canada and around the world launch their own exposure
          notification systems. It is based on the exposure notification
          technology provided by Apple & Google, the most privacy-preserving
          approach currently available.
        </p>
        <p>
          For exposure notification to be most effective, it is important that
          governments launch applications that can work together. COVID Shield
          is designed to be deployed federally, provincially, or territorially
          by enabling the server and clients to talk to each other even if there
          are multiple instances.

          How it works
        </h2>
        <p>
          COVID Shield is made up of three parts: a mobile app, a server, and a
          web-based results portal.

          <h3>Mobile app</h3>
          <p>
            Get notified if you have potentially been exposed to COVID-19. If
            you test positive for COVID-19, you can choose to anonymously share
            your data so others can be notified of possible exposure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mobile app collects and shares anonymized device identifiers
            ("random IDs") using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). COVID Shield
            periodically downloads codes from the server and checks to see if
            any of them match codes the device has encountered. COVID Shield
            runs in the background. If it detects that you have come in contact
            with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, COVID Shield will
            send you a message.

          <h3>Server</h3>
          <p>
            The backend server securely collects and stores diagnosis keys
            uploaded from the mobile app after confirmation of a positive test
            result. It also generates unique temporary codes which grant
            permission for people with a positive COVID-19 test result to upload
            their diagnosis keys. This server has been designed to work whether
            it has been deployed federally, provincially, or territorially.

          <h3>Web portal</h3>
          <p>
            The web-based results portal provides unique numeric codes to be
            given by health care professionals to patients with a confirmed
            positive COVID-19 test result. This code gives the patient access to
            upload their anonymized device identifiers (random IDs) via the app.
            There is no association between these temporary codes and specific
            COVID-19 tests or patients. The code is delivered over any
            communications channel (such as the phone) so it cannot be traced to
            any person or their test results. Use of the portal is optional, as
            the backend API also generates temporary COVID Shield codes.
