    web-based results portal."
mobile_app_title:
  other: "Mobile app (iOS and Android)"
mobile_app_content:
  other: "The mobile app runs in the background and requires no user interaction after onboarding. It uses Bluetooth to collect and share random IDs with nearby phones with COVID Shield installed. If a user tests positive for COVID-19, they can choose to anonymously share their data so others can be notified of possible exposure. Sharing of random IDs is voluntary and only possible with a positive test result confirmed by a health care professional. COVID Shield periodically downloads the shared random IDs from the server and compares them on each user’s device to determine if a possible exposure has occurred."
server_title:
  other: "Server"
server_content:
  other: "The server securely collects and stores random IDs uploaded from the mobile app after a confirmed positive test result. It also generates unique temporary codes which grant permission for people with a positive COVID-19 test result to upload their random IDs. The server is flexible enough to be deployed at various levels of government."
web_portal_title:
  other: "Web portal"
web_portal_content_1:
  other: "The web-based results portal provides health care professionals unique temporary codes which can be shared with users who have tested positive for COVID-19. This code gives a user access to upload their random IDs via the mobile app if they choose. No personal information is collected and there is no association between the codes and specific tests."
web_portal_content_2:
  other: "Use of the portal is optional, as the server can also be used to generate temporary COVID Shield codes."
